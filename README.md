# Image processing algorithm implementation

This library collects various image processing algorithms and provides simple example usage to them. From #1  to #5 algorithms are implemented in Python and runs without opencv dependencies. The #6 is a document scanner. The #7 is a turtorial of using machine learning and image processing doing image classification.
